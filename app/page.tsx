          Having had the opportunity to collaborate with multiple US companies
          over the last 7 years, I've honed my skills across various web
          technologies, primarily focusing on Front End tools. However, I've
          also undertaken Full Stack responsibilities in specific roles
          throughout my career.
          <br />
          <br />
          My passion lies in crafting clean code and implementing astute
          practices. Continuously seeking ways to enhance existing codebases and
          elevate the development experience is ingrained in my approach.
          <br />
          <br />
          Working within industries like functional tele-health and online
          fitness has granted me deep insights into optimal productivity. I
          thrive when I'm deeply engaged with my projects, seeking a profound
          understanding of their workings. For me, it's more than just coding;
          it's about actively participating and contributing meaningfully to
          each project.
